# Pictures-for-d3x_vehicleshop
Here are the pictures of the vehicles in the shop and they are optimized! (~ -65%)
Original Script/Dependancy : https://github.com/Duart3x/d3x_vehicleshop

Some vehicles are missing (those that are not RP).
## How to install

Add the picture path in fxmanifest.lua instead of writing a lot of line :
exemple :
for avoiding long line code images

just delete all HTML/Imgs/4C.png
and:
- For PNG— add this line : HTML/Imgs/*.png

- For JPG — add this line : HTML/Imgs/*.jpg

that mean all images you add inside the Html/imgs/ = loading

Verify if you have the picture in \resources\d3x_vehicleshop\HTML\imgs.
You need to verify the name and the extension (jpg isn’t jpeg, png …)

Verify your DB, in the table Vehicles make sure you have a imglink column
It should look like this :

Verify the column, edit the Collation and/or Datatype,
It must look like this :

My folder was ~470mb before, now it’s 51mb.
